    <h1>dance</h1>
      <p>
        Dance is an art form, often classified as a sport, consisting of
        sequences of body movements with aesthetic and often symbolic value,
        either improvised or purposefully selected. Dance can be categorized and
        described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements or by its
        historical period or place of origin. Dance is typically performed with
        musical accompaniment, and sometimes with the dancer simultaneously
        using a musical instrument themselves.
