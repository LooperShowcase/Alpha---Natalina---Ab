    <h1>ever country has it's own kind of dance </h1>
     <h3> these are some of the country kinds of dance </h3>

    <h3>African dance  </h3>
    <p>Thousands of dances are performed around the continent.
         These may be divided into traditional, neotraditional, and classical styles
         dances of a particular society, dances created more recently in imitation of traditional styles,
         and dances transmitted more formally in schools or private lessons.
          African dance has been altered by many forces, 
          such as European missionaries and colonialist governments,
          who often suppressed local dance traditions as licentious or distracting.
        Dance in contemporary African cultures still serves its traditional functions in new contexts;
         dance may celebrate the inauguration of a hospital,
          build community for rural migrants in unfamiliar cities,
           and be incorporated into Christian church ceremonies.</p>

           <h3>asia dance</h3>
           <p>All Indian classical dances are to varying degrees rooted in the Natyashastra and therefore share common features: 
            for example, the hand positions, some body positions,
             leg movement and the inclusion of dramatic or expressive acting or abhinaya.
              Indian classical music provides accompaniment and
               dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion.</p>

             <h2>Latin America dance </h2>
               <p>Dance is central to Latin American social life and culture.
                 Brazilian Samba, Argentinian tango, and Cuban salsa are internationally popular partner dances,
                  and other national dances—merengue, cueca, plena, jarabe, joropo, marinera, cumbia, bachata and
                 others—are important components of their respective countries' cultures.
                 Traditional Carnival festivals incorporate these and other dances in enormous celebrations</p>

                 <h3> Arabic folk dance </h3>
                 <p>Dabke is an Arabic folk dance which originated in the mountains of the Levantine region; 
                    including Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan & Syria.
                     Dabke is derived from the Levantine Arabic word dabaka دبكة meaning “stamping of the feet” or “to make a noise”
