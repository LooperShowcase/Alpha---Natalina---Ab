      <h2> when was dance invented?</h2>
      <p>
         Paintings made in caves more than 10,000 years
        ago suggest that even the earliest peoples danced. The first written
        records of dance date back some 4,000 years to the ancient Egyptians.
        Dance was a crucial element in festivals for their gods.

      <p>
        Archaeological evidence for early dance includes 10,000-years-old
        paintings in Madhya Pradesh, India at the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka,
        and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures ,dated 3300 BC. It
        has been proposed that before the invention of written languages, dance
        was an important part of the oral and performance methods of passing
        stories down from one generation to the next. The use of dance in
        ecstatic trance states and healing rituals (as observed today in many
        contemporary indigenous cultures) is thought to have been another early
        factor in the social development of dance.

      <p>
        The first dances were used in religion and were a way of sharing stories
        about Gods and their adventures.
      </p>
      <p>References to dance can be found in very early recorded history;
         Greek dance (choros) is referred to by Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch and Lucian.
         The Bible and Talmud refer to many events related to dance,
         and contain over 30 different dance terms. 
         In Chinese pottery as early as the Neolithic period,
         groups of people are depicted dancing in a line holding hands,
         and the earliest Chinese word for "dance" is found written in the oracle bones.
         Dance is described in the LÃ¼shi Chunqiu.
        Primitive dance in ancient China was associated with sorcery and shamanic rituals.</p>
